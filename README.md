# Statue Quest

## Overview
Statue Quest is an app created to give users the opportunity to interact with the City of Philadelphia. Users get the opportunity to look up various landmarks in Philadelphia and log their trip on our website using selfie uploads.

Sequelize 
Express.js

Google maps api
City of Philadelphia Public Buildings Open Source Data


## How it Works

To begin the quest, the user navigates to the Get Started page. Here the list of 80+ City of Philadelphia statues is displayed with their address and GPS coordinates. The user then will need to go to the statue selected and take a selfie of themselves in front of the statue. If the location of the user is validated as being at the location of the statue selected, the user will be able to post their selfie to the Logged Trips page. If they are not at the statue location, the picture will not post to the Logged Trips page.

This project was difficult on many fronts to obtain the MVP. Future enhancements would include making the table and other elements more responsive, especially for mobile devices. Ability to create log in and log trips to a user account, create a toggle button that differentiates a users photos from all photos, and expand the functionality to show statues across the Greater Philadelphia Region.
